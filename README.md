# Dissertation

This is a 3D linear survival horror game created as part of my dissertation. The research focused on the effects on player experience of manipulating player agency. 


The game's challenge consists of monsters which chase and attack the player, which were implemented using the Unity NavMesh system. To protect themselves, the player is provided a gun, which fires using ray casts from the camera.

As the game is set in a trench, the player can shoot monsters over the trench using a secondary periscope gun. This effect was achieved with a UI overlay combined with a camera height adjustment and comes with a no-scope mechanic implemented by adding randomisation to the ray cast origin.

To test the research topic, an alternative version of the game was created, where there are 3 moments of temporary reduced player agency. For example, both games contain a gas attack sequence, implemented using a particle system. However, the alpha is adjusted such that the player's vision is obscured in the alternative game version, as opposed to the cloud only being only aesthetical:

The game's controls are provided through text popups at relevant points of gameplay.
